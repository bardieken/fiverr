Hello and wellcome!
You can run program by typing
go run main.go input.txt output.txt
output.txt file can be named to anything. ex: result.txt
input.txt contains all 4 test together. I did that to help you quickly audit my program.
input.txt:
1. line is the line needs to corrected.
2. line is the correct line. 
So in result output file:
1. line of text and 2. line of text should be identical.
If you want you can try all tests 1 by 1 also.
Thanks and best regards
